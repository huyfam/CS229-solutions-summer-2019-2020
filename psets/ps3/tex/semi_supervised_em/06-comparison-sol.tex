\begin{answer}
i. The semi-supervised EM took much less iterations to converge, up to $291/24 \approx 12$ times. \\
ii. The cluster assignments are more stable in the semi-supervised EM, as oppose to the unsupervised EM. \\
iii. This dataset contains 3 low-variance Gaussian distributions which are closely replaced and a forth high-variance Gaussian distribution that overlaps with the first 3. Still, the semi-supervised EM could take advantage of additional information about the cluster identities of some examples to isolate clusters accurately. \\
