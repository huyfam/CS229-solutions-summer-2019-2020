\begin{answer}
i., ii. Modifying the selection scheme for learning rates doesn't change the 
linear separability, hence the model wouldn't converge. \\
iii. Linear transformation doesn't remove the separability of dataset B, hence 
the model still wouldn't converge. \\
iv. Regularization can help in this case. The cost function is modified and 
might have a minimum now. \\
v. Adding noise terms might break the separability and make the model converge.
