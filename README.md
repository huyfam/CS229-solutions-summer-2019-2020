*"This is the summer edition of CS229 Machine Learning that was offered over 2019 and 2020. CS229 provides a broad introduction to statistical machine learning (at an intermediate / advanced level) and covers supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical ); and reinforcement learning among other topics. The structure of the summer offering enables coverage of additional topics, places stronger emphasis on the mathematical and visual intuitions, and goes deeper into the details of various topics."*
